def calibrate_model(nst, gamma, sdofCapArray, isFrame, isSOS):    
    """
    Calibrate Multi-Degree-of-Freedom (MDOF) storey force-deformation relationships based on Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) capacity functions.
    
    This function computes the MDOF storey forces, displacements, and mode shape by transforming SDOF-based capacity curves, 
    accounting for factors such as the number of storeys, building class, and presence of soft-storey or frame structures. 
    The model applies a series of physical assumptions and simplifications, including uniform mass distribution and 
    standardized stiffness matrices.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    nst : int
        The number of storeys in the building (must be a positive integer).
        
    gamma : float
        The SDOF-MDOF transformation factor. This factor adjusts the response of the MDOF system based on the SDOF capacity.
        
    sdof_capacity : array-like, shape (n, 2 or 3 or 4)
        The SDOF spectral capacity data, where:
        - Column 1 represents spectral displacements or accelerations.
        - Column 2 represents spectral forces or accelerations.
        - (For a trilinear/quadrilinear capacity curve) Additional columns may represent subsequent branches of the curve.

    isFrame : bool
        Flag indicating whether the building is a framed structure (True) or braced structure (False).
        
    isSOS : bool
        Flag indicating whether the building contains a soft-storey (True) or not (False).
        
    Returns
    -------
    flm_mdof : list of float
        The MDOF floor masses, which are derived based on the mode shape and transformation factor.
        
    stD_mdof : list of float
        The MDOF storey displacements, adjusted for each floor and the applied SDOF capacity curve.
        
    stF_mdof : list of float
        The MDOF storey forces, computed based on the calibrated capacity functions.
        
    phi_mdof : list of float
        The expected mode shape for the MDOF system, normalized to have a unit norm.

    Notes
    -----
    - If the building has a soft-storey, a modified stiffness matrix is used with reduced stiffness for the last floor.
    - The mode shape is derived using a generalized eigenvalue problem with mass and stiffness matrices.
    - The function handles various types of SDOF capacity curves (bilinear, trilinear, quadrilinear) to calibrate the MDOF system.
    - The effective mass for the SDOF system is computed assuming uniform mass distribution across floors.
